# NBA-Dashboard

## OVERVIEW: 
- A comprehensive dashboard containing data analysis on the factors that affect NBA team wins.

## ABSTRACT:
- This project analyzes the effects that certain “play-related” and “non-play-related” variables have on NBA team wins. 
- Data is gathered from each of the 30 NBA teams, for each of the 2013-2019 NBA seasons. 
- I define “play-related” variables as team statistics recorded on the court of play during games (examples include rebounds or 3 point shooting percentage). 
- I define “non-play-related” variables as statistics recorded outside the court of play (examples include tickets sold or team salary).

## GOAL:
- The goal is, through exploratory data analysis, to provide NBA executives and team managers with specific advice/suggestions on ways to improve their total team wins.
